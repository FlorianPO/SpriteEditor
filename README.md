# SpriteEditor
A powerful bitmap manipulating software meant for developpers.

Sprite Editor is an old project: back in time I needed to draw 
sprite sheets and could hardly find a software able to display
in real-time the animation I was editing.

I performed this software 3 years ago with SFML, it was quickly 
operationnal (2 weeks) but the programming was terrible (as I was
a beginner in C++).

Years past and I decided to redo it with my new skills.
I started this in January 2015, and it's still not over.
This has nothing to do with what it used to be, since I started
exploiting OpenGL.

History:

SE 1: first version of Sprite Editor ("childish" programming)

SE 2: new version, fully using C++ and using OpenGL

SE 3: adding a complete panel framework

SE 4: revised version with fast and stable architecture (current version)

Sprite Editor is meant to be as powerful, intuitive and simple as possible.
It will provide tons of easy features meant to speed up graphical programming.

The current situation is promising, since Sprite Editor is - a bit too much - fast and modular.
