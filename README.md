# SpriteEditor
A powerful bitmap manipulating software meant for developpers

Sprite Editor is an old project : back in time I needed to draw 
sprite sheets and could hardly find a software able to display
in real-time the animation I was editing.

Sprite Editor is meant to be as powerful, intuitive and simple as possible.
It will provide tons of easy features meant to speed up graphical programming.

The current situation with Qt is promising, but there is a lot to do.
